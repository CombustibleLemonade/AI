This is a partial replacement for the school system I'm working on. It's far from even it's alpha stage. It's main features will include:
- Virtual learning system, based on user-generated content.
- The option to add your own lessons, which can replace previous lessons for certain users.
- Block based achievement system, capable of keeping track of pupils' progress.
- An edit mode, to enable user-based content generation.
- Questions based on one or more blocks the pupil has mastered. These will be asked after

Very far away future plans:
- Algorithmic optimisations for deduction of most eficient learning methods for individual pupils.
- Using recommendations to steer the learning experience towards the most fun and productive experience, and towards the changing demands of the industry.
