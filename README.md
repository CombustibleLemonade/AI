This is a partial replacement for the school system I'm working on. It's far from even it's alpha stage. It's main features will include:
- Virtual learning system, which can be easily altered.
- The option to add your own explanation/lessons, which can replace previous lessons for certain users.
- Block based achievement system, which is capable of keeping track of what every single individual student has learened, and capable of setting up a specific path of "blocks" to follow in order to learn a certain bit of knowledge.
